## Gregory Putzel, Ph.D.

I studied math and physics at Carnegie Mellon University and went to grad school in physics at the University of Washington in Seattle, doing theoretical research in the biophysics of lipid membranes. As a postdoctoral researcher in the department of Biomedical Engineering at Northwestern University, I studied the biophysics of gene regulation. Later I worked as a postdoctoral fellow in the Neurology department of Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York City, looking for the genetic causes of spasmodic dysphonia, a motor control disorder impairing speech. Currently I am Staff Bioinformatician at the [Jill Roberts Center for Inflammatory Bowel Disease](https://robertsinstitute.weill.cornell.edu/) at Weill Cornell Medicine, where I am also in charge of bioinformatics for the [Microbiome Core Lab](https://www.microbiome.weill.cornell.edu/).
